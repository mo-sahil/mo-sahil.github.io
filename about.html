        <h1>Mo Sahil | B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am Mo Sahil, a -year B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering at Lovely Professional University. I have a profound passion for data science and its transformative potential in driving meaningful insights and decision-making.</p>

        <h2>Background and Education</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Bangarmau, Uttar Pradesh, India. After completing high school, I took a gap year to prepare for the JEE entrance exam. Although I did not achieve the desired results, this period was crucial in kindling my passion for computer science and setting me on the path to pursue it as a career.</p>

        <h2>Academic Projects and Achievements</h2>
        <p>During my time at Lovely Professional University, I have undertaken several significant projects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Developed a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my front-end development capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Irrigation System:</strong> As part of my Basic Electronics and Electrical Engineering coursework, I designed and implemented a smart irrigation system. This project automatically activates watering when soil moisture levels are low, demonstrating my ability to apply technical knowledge to practical, real-world problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Studies Research:</strong> Conducted a research project titled "Changing Food Habits and Their Impact on Food Resources in India" for my Environmental Studies subject. This project enhanced my research, analytical, and problem-solving skills.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In my second semester, I worked on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Courier Management System:</strong> Developed a basic console-based courier management system using C language. This project involved creating an efficient system to manage and track courier services, further honing my programming and problem-solving abilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In my third semester, I started learning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):</strong> Initiated my journey into DSA using C++, building a solid foundation in essential algorithms and data structures.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In my fourth semester, I began my data science journey by learning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>R Language and MS Excel:</strong> Gained proficiency in R language and MS Excel, foundational tools in the field of data science, marking the start of my specialization in this domain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Skills and Goals</h2>
        <p>I possess a strong foundation in programming languages including JavaScript, Python, C, C++, and SQL. My proficiency in time management allows me to balance academic commitments with project deadlines effectively. I am a quick learner, continually seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and stay updated with the latest advancements in the field.</p>
        <p>My ultimate goal is to become a Data Scientist, leveraging data analysis to derive valuable insights and drive strategic decision-making. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge in this domain and contribute significantly to the field.</p>

        <h2>Seeking Internship Opportunities</h2>
        <p>I am actively seeking internship opportunities in data science to gain hands-on experience and further develop my skills. I am open to exploring various industries and organizations that can provide a nurturing environment for my growth.</p>
        <p>Thank you for considering my application. I am confident that my dedication, passion for computer science, and project experiences make me a strong candidate for internships in data science. If you would like to discuss my qualifications further or explore potential collaboration, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:sahilbmu@gmail.com">sahilbmu@gmail.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your time, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your organization.</p>
